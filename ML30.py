we are with the sybllabus for ML


Machine learning term was coined by sir Arthur Samuel of the 
standford university in 1959.


According to Dr. Samuel,


"Machine Learning is the technique to train machines \
    with data without explicit programming ."
    
    Dr. Samuel's"definition is a little vague."
    The engineering oriented definition of ML was provided by 
    Tom Michell of the standford university in the year 1999.

    "A machine is said to heve Learn from experience E over \
        some task T with a performance measure P if  on  task T \
            the Performance P increases with exprience E"
            
            
   Task: Robot walking from point A to B 
   Exprience:0
   Performance :No of obstacles

 At first training step

Task:Robot walking from point A to B 
   Exprience:1
   Performance :Poor

After training for a while 


Task: Robot walking from point A to B 
   Exprience:100
   Performance :Good
   
   this can be termed as ML
   
   
   
   Classification of ML systems
   
   1.Whether or not it needs human superviseion
        a)Supervised Learning
        b)Unsupervised Learning
        c)Semisupervised Learning
        d) Reinforcement Learning
    
 2.Wether or not it can incrementally Learn on the fly
     a)Online based Learning
    b) Batch Learning
 3. Whether it generalizes on known set of points or rather creates a model
    
   A) Model based Learning
   B)instance based Learning
